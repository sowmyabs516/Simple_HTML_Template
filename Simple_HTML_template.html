            <p>Renewable energy is energy produced from sources like the sun and wind that are naturally
                 replenished and do not run out. Renewable energy can be used for electricity generation,
                  space and water heating and cooling, and transportation.

                Non-renewable energy, in contrast, comes from finite sources that could get used up, such
                 as fossil fuels like coal and oil.</p>
